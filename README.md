# Spotify Metadata AS3 API
Use the Metadata API to explore the Spotify music catalog and retrieved track, album and artist data. 
Unfortuneately this API is now depricated. Keeping it here for historical purposes.

###Disclaimer
It's old (27 th of January 2011), raw and unedited, loads of stuff in here i would probably not do again or ever again ;-). Back then was used as production code. Right now use for learning purposes and at your own risk. 

Enjoy!
